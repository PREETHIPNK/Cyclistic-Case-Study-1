# Problem Statement

## Introduction
Welcome to the Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study! In this project, Assuming that I will take on the role of a data analyst working for Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. My task is to analyze the historical trip data provided by Cyclistic and derive insights to inform marketing strategies aimed at increasing annual memberships following the e steps of the data analysis process: Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.
## About the Cyclistic Company
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations
across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a solid opportunity to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Moreno has set a clear goal: Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## My Role
As a data analyst at Cyclistic, my responsibilities include:
- Analyzing historical trip data to understand user behavior.
- Identifying key differences between annual members and casual riders.
- Formulating recommendations to convert casual riders into annual members.
- Collaborating with the marketing team to design effective marketing campaigns.
- Presenting findings and recommendations to stakeholders for decision-making.

## Objectives
1. Analyze historical trip data to identify patterns and trends in bike usage.
2. Determine key differences between annual members and casual riders in terms of usage behavior.
3. Formulate recommendations to convert casual riders into annual members, ultimately maximizing annual memberships for Cyclistic.

## Business Context
Cyclistic's marketing director believes that maximizing the number of annual members is crucial for the company's future success. Annual members are more profitable than casual riders, and increasing annual memberships can lead to sustainable growth for Cyclistic. Therefore, understanding how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently is essential for designing effective marketing strategies.

## Key Questions
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. What factors influence casual riders' decisions to become annual members?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Approach
We will analyze the historical trip data provided by Cyclistic to answer the key questions outlined above. By conducting thorough exploratory data analysis and statistical analysis, we aim to gain insights into user behavior and preferences. These insights will then be used to formulate actionable recommendations to achieve Cyclistic's business objectives.
