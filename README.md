# Problem Statement

## Introduction
Welcome to the Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study! In this project, you will take on the role of a data analyst working for Cyclistic, a fictional bike-share company in Chicago. My task is to analyze the historical trip data provided by Cyclistic and derive insights to inform marketing strategies aimed at increasing annual memberships.

## My Role
As a data analyst at Cyclistic, my responsibilities include:
- Analyzing historical trip data to understand user behavior.
- Identifying key differences between annual members and casual riders.
- Formulating recommendations to convert casual riders into annual members.
- Collaborating with the marketing team to design effective marketing campaigns.
- Presenting findings and recommendations to stakeholders for decision-making.

## Objectives
1. Analyze historical trip data to identify patterns and trends in bike usage.
2. Determine key differences between annual members and casual riders in terms of usage behavior.
3. Formulate recommendations to convert casual riders into annual members, ultimately maximizing annual memberships for Cyclistic.

## Business Context
Cyclistic's marketing director believes that maximizing the number of annual members is crucial for the company's future success. Annual members are more profitable than casual riders, and increasing annual memberships can lead to sustainable growth for Cyclistic. Therefore, understanding how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently is essential for designing effective marketing strategies.

## Key Questions
1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2. What factors influence casual riders' decisions to become annual members?
3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Approach
We will analyze the historical trip data provided by Cyclistic to answer the key questions outlined above. By conducting thorough exploratory data analysis and statistical analysis, we aim to gain insights into user behavior and preferences. These insights will then be used to formulate actionable recommendations to achieve Cyclistic's business objectives.
